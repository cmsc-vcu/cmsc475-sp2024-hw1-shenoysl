# Satya's CMSC 475 Homework 1!

This is the first homework assignment for this course, which gives me my first look into how homework assignments will generally be laid out

The repo that I am in right now is a fork of a template created by Dr. Leonard, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/about-forks) 

For the assignment I am tasked with: 

1. Installing software tools listed in the [homework 1 description on Canvas](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/93957/assignments/853460?module_item_id=3241421).  Then,

2. Rendering the *example-1.qmd* file found in the *hw1* folder of this repository.  This contains an example
of many different styles of embedding.

3. Updating the *homework-1.qmd* file found in the *hw1* folder of this repository.  Instructions for updating the file can be found in the file itself.

4. Once updated, *render* the *QMD* file to create *homework-1.html* file.

5. Once rendered, uploading *homework-1.html* to Canvas.

6. Submitting this repository (be sure to commit and push your changes) to Gradescope.

7. Finally, introducing myself in the [course discussion](https://virginiacommonwealth.instructure.com/courses/93957/discussion_topics/712041) on Canvas!
